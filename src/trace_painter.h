       The primary issue is that often, there are several arrows
       with the same start position, and zero delta_y. If we draw
       them as straight lines, they will overlap, and look ugly.
       We can't avoid overlap in general, but this case is very
       comment and better be handled.

       The approach is to make arrows with zero delta y curved.
       When delta y is large enough (or, more specifically, the
       angle to horisontal is small enough, arrow will be drawn as
       straigh line.
       We compute the angle of straight line between start and end
       to horisontal, and the compute "delta angle" -- angle to that
       straight line that will have start and end segments of the curve.
       For angle of 90 (delta y is zero), delta angle is 30.
       For a "limit angle" of 10, delta angle is 0 (the line is straight)
       For intermediate angles, we interporal.
